# Youtube_Comments_Scraper
This repository is for my youtube automation tool for scraping comments from videos

Requirements: Python 3.6, Selenium, Pandas, Chrome Driver

The idea is to use Selenium in order to:
 1. Scroll to the bottom of the page
 2. Scrape new loaded comments
 3. Repeat the process while scrolling is possible
After that, I'll use Pandas to store the scraped data in the Dataframe.
